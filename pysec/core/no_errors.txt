owasp-pysec/pysec/core/dirent.c:37:38:
    Local kwlist[1] initialized to null value: kwlist[1] = NULL
  A reference with no null annotation is assigned or initialized to NULL.  Use
  /*@null@*/ to declare the reference as a possibly null pointer. (Use
  -nullassign to inhibit warning)


owasp-pysec/pysec/core/dirent.c:38:78:
    Passed storage &path not completely defined:
    _PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords_SizeT (..., &path)
  Storage derivable from a parameter, return value or global is not defined.
  Use /*@out@*/ to denote passed or returned storage which need not be defined.
  (Use -compdef to inhibit warning)


owasp-pysec/pysec/core/dirent.c:38:10: Operand of ! is non-boolean (int):
    !_PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords_SizeT(args, kwds, "s:opendir", kwlist, &path)
  The operand of a boolean operator is not a boolean. Use +ptrnegate to allow !
  to be used on pointers. (Use -boolops to inhibit warning)

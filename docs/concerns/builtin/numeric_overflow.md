Numeric overflow in builtin function xrange
===========================================

Classification
--------------------------

* **Affected Components** : builtin

* **Operating System** : Linux

* **Python Versions** : 2.6.x, 2.7.x, 3.1.x, 3.2.x

* **Reproducible** : Yes


Source code 
--------------------------

```python
import sys

N = 2 ** 63

for n in xrange(N):
    print n

sys.exit(0)

```


Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------

To reproduce the problem copy the `source code` in a file and execute the script using the following command syntax:

```python
$ python -OOBRtt test.py
```

Alternatively you can open python in interactive mode:

```python
$ python -OOBRtt <press enter>
```
Then copy the lines of code into the interpreter.  


Description
-----------

The execution of the test code will produce an ```Overflow``` error as the object we are trying to load is bigger than the maximum object supported natively by the operating system.

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 5, in <module>
    for n in xrange(N):
OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long
```

Even if this behaviour is "by design" and expected, this condition is not detected by the interpreter and a numeric overflow is generated by the python core libraries.

This happens because ```xrange``` uses "Plain Integer Objects" created by the OS and cannot accept objects of arbitrary length.

The problem of numeric length can be easily solved by using python "long integer object“, the underlying problem of the numeric Overflow must be fixed in the core libraries.


Workaround
-----------


We are not aware on any **easy** solution other than trying to avoid using ```'xrange'``` in cases like the one examined.

But a **PERMANENT SOLUTION** is available, just use python "long integer object“ that will allow numbers of arbitrary length as the limit will be the system's memory.
